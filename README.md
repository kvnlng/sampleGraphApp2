# sampleGraphApp2
Sample Neo4j graph query example using JSF bean backing

Proof of concept project connecting a simple search query frontend webpage to Java server faces backing bean.
The POC also contains a simple proof of returning data to a d3 javascript graph.

Intentions here are to provide a framework for implementing a MVC design, Java backing beans for programmatic data structing
and querying the Neo4J backend. This enables the framework to take advantage of powerful data structures and libraries such as
GSON to return JSON objects to a D3 frontend.
